    "Globally, about 62% of the precipitation that falls on the continents is evapotranspirated, amounting to 73 thousand km$^3$/yr. Of this, about 42% (29 thousand km$^3$/yr) is transpiration, and about 3% is open-water evaporation. Most of the remainder is interception loss; soil evaporation is a minor component of the total.\n",

    "\n",
    "Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) is the rate at which evapotranspiration would occur from a large area completely and uniformly covered with growing vegetation with access to an unlimited supply of soil water and without advection or heat-storage effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several characteristics of a vegetative surface have a strong influence on ET rate. a) the albedo of the surface, which determines the net radiation; b) the maximum leaf conductance; c) the atmospheric conductance, largely determined by vegetation height; d) presence or absence of intercepted water.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference-Crop Evapotranspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference-crop evapotranspiration (RET) is the amount of water transpired by a short green crop, completely shading the ground, of uniform height, and never short of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of PET is often calculated from meteorological data collected under conditions in which the actual ET rate **is less than the potential rate**. If ET had been occurring at the potential rate, the latent- and sensible-heat exchanges between air and the surface, and hence the air temperature and humidity, would have been considerably different.

    "\n",
    "Source: Ward & Trimble, \"Environmental Hydrology\", 2nd Edition, pages 107-108.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thornthwaite (1948) developed an equation to predict monthly evapotranspiration from mean monthly tempera- ture and latitude data (Equation 4.27). The small amount of data needed is attractive because often ET needs to be predicted for sites where few weather data are available. Based on what we know about ET, we should be skeptical about the general applicability of such a simple equation. Thornthwaite (1948) was not satisfied with the proposed approach: “The mathematical development is far from satisfactory. It is empirical. ... The chief obstacle at present to the development of a rational equation is the lack of understanding of why potential ET corresponding to a given temperature is not the same everywhere.”  \n",
    "Taylor and Ashcroft (1972), as cited in Skaggs (1980), provided insight into the answer to Thornthwaite’s ques- tion. They said:  \n",
    "> This equation, being based entirely upon a temperature relationship, has the disadvantage of a rather flimsy phys- ical basis and has only weak theoretical justification. Since temperature and vapor pressure gradients are mod- ified by the movement of air and by the heating of the soil and surroundings, the formula is not generally valid, but must be tested empirically whenever the climate is appreciably different from areas in which it has been tested. ... In spite of these shortcomings, the method has been widely used. Because it is based entirely on temper- ature data that are available in a large number of localities, it can be applied in situations where the basic data of the Penman method are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "M.E. Jensen et al. (1990) warn that Thornthwaite’s method is generally only applicable to areas that have climates similar to that of the east central U.S., and it is not applicable to arid and semiarid regions.\n",
