    "\n",
    "1. because we are dealing with long-term averages, there are negligible changes of watershed stored water.\n",
    "2. negligible energy is stored at the soil surface, and heat transfer from soil surface to deeper soil layers ($G$) averages zero.\n",

    "Given measurements of rainfall and meteorological conditions, can we predict the partitioning of $P$ between $ET$ and $Q$?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "For very dry watersheds (deserts, for example), almost all precipitation ($P$) is lost via evapotranspiration ($ET$). These watersheds are called water limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "In wet watersheds, at the annual scale, the sensible heat ($H$) is directed from the surface to the atmosphere in almost all climatic zones on Earth (meaning: soil heats air). Therefore, $H$ cannot supply much energy to the soil surface, and it is assumed that $R_n$ provides entirely the energy required for evapotranspiration.  Dividing the second equation by $\\lambda_w$, we get $R_n/\\lambda_w = ET + H/\\lambda_w$. It is clear that the maximum possible $ET$ occurs when all incoming radiation energy $R_n$ is consumed by evapotranspiration $ET$, and there is negligible sensible heat flux  $H$. As a result, the upper limit of $\\lambda_w E$ is $R_n$, in wet watersheds. In these watersheds, called energy limited, $ET$ tends to the potential evapotranspiration ($ET_0$).\n",

    "## Hypotheses for why dryness index controls so much the partitioning of P into ET and Q\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The first is that the Budyko curve is accurate because landscape features (e.g., soils and vegetation) coevolve with the local climate in such a manner that precipitation partitioning into streamflow and evapotranspiration converges towards the Budyko curve \n",
    "2. A second hypothesis is that catchments over time evolve towards the supply and demand limits (rather than towards a curve), because landscapes and their vegetation are unaware of the Budyko curve but do evolve to maximize their use of available resources (including water). However, because limiting factors such as climatic variability exist (which will reduce a catchment's ability to use all water because it cannot fully buffer the highly variable precipitation input), catchments will tend to not reach these limits. This may lead to an (apparent) existence of the Budyko curve which falls relatively close to the demand and supply limits.\n",
    "3. A third hypothesis is that the existence of a strong universal relationship between aridity and catchment water balances might be explained by an underlying organizing principle such as maximum entropy production because the Budyko curve may be consistent with how hydrologic systems optimally partition water and energy\n",
    "4. A fourth hypothesis is that virtually any landscape and climate combination (also those in heavily disturbed landscapes: e.g., a city, agricultural lands, etc.) will fall near the Budyko curve because climate aridity will dominate precipitation partitioning largely independent of the climate-landscape configuration or any optimization principle."

The validity of this assumption remains mostly untested, which seems surprising given it underpins all of these studies' findings."
